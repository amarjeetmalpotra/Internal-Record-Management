# Internal-Record-Management
This web based project is created using ASP.NET along with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and more.<br>
This can be helpful for small administration along with teachers who can easily manage internal subject records of students by logging in and selecting their respective subject they deal with.<br>
Along with this, students can even view their records which were updated by their respective subject's teacher.<br>
An admin hub is present, through which admin can add new teachers and even change their passwords.<br>
The complete website is very user as well as mobile/tablet freindly, i.e it is optimised for best appearance in small devices, just because students generally browse through mobile/tablet devices.<br>
Teachers also have a print facility available in case they want to display the records on a notice board.<br>
Initially developed in Visual Studio Community 2019.<br>
